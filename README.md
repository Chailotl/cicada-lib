# CICADA

CICADA (proper backronym pending) is a library mod containing 
general utilities and common abstractions I use in many of my mod projects.

Some of its features include:

- An api to facilitate inter-mod conversations in the game log.
- Other logging tomfoolery.
- A custom cloak renderer.
- A GSON based self-managed mod config template class.
- An abstract mixin plugin to facilitate compatibility mixins.
